📄 Project Name: RD Group - Financial Management App (Detailed Specification)
(Is pure text ko copy karke ek PDF ya Text file bana lijiye aur developer ko dijiye)
1. Introduction & Core Objective
I need a Flutter + Firebase app for a private financial group ("RD Group"). The app manages monthly contributions, loans, and strict penalties for 22 specific members. My Contact: [Yahan Apna Email ID Dalein] | Phone number available upon request for serious developers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. User Roles & Authentication Logic
• Login: OTP-based Login (Firebase Auth) [Source: 23].
• The "Dual Role" Concept (CRITICAL):
    ◦ Admin (Operator): Users named 'Deepak', 'Rohit Arya', 'Rupesh' [Source: 3, 34].
    ◦ Member: Everyone else.
    ◦ Note: Admins are ALSO members. They have their own personal dashboards, pay their own loans, and pay their own monthly ₹500. Do not create separate Admin accounts. Use a role field in the database [Source: 25].
• Multi-Account Support: A user can have multiple IDs (e.g., Rupesh 01, Rupesh 02) linked to one phone number. They must be able to "Switch Account" from the profile menu [Source: 23, 24].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Navigation Structure
• Bottom Navigation: Icons ONLY (No Text Labels) [Source: 34].
• Tabs for MEMBERS: 1. Group Data, 2. Home (Personal), 3. History.
• Tabs for ADMINS: 1. Group Data, 2. Home (Personal), 3. History, 4. Admin Panel [Source: 25].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Feature Breakdown & Logic
A. Home Dashboard (Personal View)
• Data: Show Total Deposit, Lifetime Loan Taken, Lifetime Loan Repaid [Source: 13].
• Active Loan Card: Show EMI Amount, Next Due Date, and Missed EMI Count [Source: 13, 27].
• Pay Now Button:
    ◦ Opens UPI Intent (GPay/PhonePe).
    ◦ No Screenshot Upload: User simply confirms "Yes, I paid" after returning to the app.
    ◦ Status goes to 'Pending' in Firestore. It only becomes 'Success' when Admin approves it [Source: 13, 27].
• EMI Logic:
    ◦ Full Pay Toggle: A switch to pay the full outstanding amount (Principal + Interest till date) instead of just one EMI [Source: 14, 28].
    ◦ Grace Period: Payment button active for Due Date + 2 Days. Post that, a fine applies [Source: 15].
B. Admin Panel (The Brain of the App)
• Card 1: Approvals: List of 'Pending' payments. Clicking 'Approve' adds money to the Main Group Fund and updates the user's ledger [Source: 18, 29].
• Card 2: Loan Issuance Engine:
    ◦ Medical Toggle: If ON, the loan amount is deducted from the 20% Medical Reserve, NOT the Main Fund [Source: 12, 30].
    ◦ Member Type:
        ▪ Existing Member: Interest 1% to 3% based on tenure [Source: 7].
        ▪ Non-Member: Requires Name, Phone, and a Guarantor (dropdown of existing members). Interest 3%-4% [Source: 8, 20].
    ◦ EMI Type: Standard (Principal+Interest) OR Interest-Only (pay interest every 30/60 days) [Source: 20, 30].
• Card 3: Add Member (Auto-Calculation Logic):
    ◦ When adding a new member mid-year (e.g., June 2026), the joining fee is Auto-Calculated:
    ◦ Formula = (Months Passed * ₹500) + (Months Passed * ₹150 Fine) [Source: 7, 22].
    ◦ Admin cannot edit this amount; it ensures fairness.
C. History Tab (Transparency)
• A "Facebook-style" timeline showing all Money IN and Money OUT events [Source: 32].
• Color Code: Green for Deposits, Red for Loans/Expenses.
• Search: Search by name or transaction type [Source: 18, 32].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Financial Rules (The Database Logic)
• Monthly Contribution: ₹500/month mandatory [Source: 5].
• Late Fines:
    ◦ 1st-4th: ₹0
    ◦ 5th-10th: ₹50
    ◦ 11th-20th: ₹100
    ◦ 21st-End: ₹150 [Source: 6].
• Medical Reserve Fund: Strictly 20% of the Total Collection is kept aside for Medical Emergencies. This is a separate field in the database (medicalReserve) [Source: 11, 12].
• Loan Fines: ₹50 per missed EMI month. If unpaid, the fine increases and adds to the principal [Source: 9, 15, 16].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Technical Requirements
• Platform: Flutter (Android).
• Backend: Firebase Firestore & Auth.
• Database Structure:
    ◦ users (Profile + Personal Stats)
    ◦ global_stats (Total Fund, Medical Reserve)
    ◦ loans (Active Loan Calculations)
    ◦ transactions (Pending Approvals Queue)
    ◦ activity_log (History Timeline)
